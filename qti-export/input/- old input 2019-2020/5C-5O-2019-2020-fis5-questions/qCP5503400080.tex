The atomic bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki in 1945 %killed 140,000 people.
%end World War II on the next day.  helping to end %It 
released energy equivalent to that of 20,000 tons of TNT explosive. 
Compute how much mass was converted to energy when this took place, knowing that
1000 tons of TNT = $4.3 \times 10^{12}\ \mathrm{J}$.
%Incidentally, modern H-bombs have energy yields 1000 times as much!
